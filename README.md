## Mission
GenZScript is a language based upon the illustrious GenZ generation. 

## Installation
To use, download the .zip and extract the contents or clone the repository by typing

```bash
git clone ...
```

Add the GenZScrip root directory to your system `PATH` using one of the two following techniques

1. Temporary: Write `export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/GenZScript/bin` to terminal.
2. Permanent: Append `export PATH=$PATH:/path/to/GenZScrip/bin` to the end of your `~/.bashrc` file.

## Usage
* Write a GenZScrip file following the syntax we've specified (good luck).
* Execute `Z /path/to/genzscript/file.z`
* Enjoy the wonderful world of GenZScrip!

## Features
Our language includes several convenient features, perfect for any aspiring Presidential candidate including:
* ...
* ...
* ...

If you find you can't get any GenZScrip to run on your computer (probably because we disallow the two most popular operating systems), you can specify the `--shut_up` flag to let the interpreter know you just want your code to run, damn it.

## Grammar
The grammar of the language is fairly convoluted, but here's a taste of the enlightened decisions we've made.

Arithmetic operators:
* +, -, ...
* ...
* ...

Control flow:
* ...
* ...
* ...

The exciting parts:

Example:
```
I was cruising my whip giving main character energy when 5-0 said i was givin ohio at a stop sign.
I was shocked.
low key gaslight?
i was head empty until i peeped some bud that dead ass put his stop sign the shadow realm!
```

But most importantly, Gen Z can't explain enymore. So a lot of the time your code will fail, and it will do so silently. Just think of debugging as a fun little game.
